## Hello there. 

Here goes the first post on this blog. It's not anything important though just a thing to set expectations for the future. I'm working on a little game project written from scratch(in the sense of no game engine) in Rust so I hope to publish a couple of articles about basic game programming techniques that are not covered well enough in different sources. I have a lot of different interests and projects going on so anything can happen. Also, there won't be any comments to start with but they may appear later.
