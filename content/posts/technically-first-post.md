## Hey

So I've been trying to force myself for a while to start something like this. It's gonna be a technical blog consisting of posts about my experiments and hobby projects.

I guess I should introduce myself even though there is(or must be) an about page here but oh well here we go. My name is Dima and I'm a software developer. I've been working in the game industry for 4 years already. I've been on both sides of AAA game programming:

* Putting together complex gameplay systems and cursing on engine programmers because the engine is constantly breaking in some new and creative way.
* Creating performant low-level engine systems and seeing Hyrum's law in action at a scale my brain was having trouble to comprehend.

So yeah, I'll try to keep posting here about game engine performance and animation(my favourite part of game engines) but othere topics may sneak in as well as I stumble on interesting things or encounter new things during my work.

Have a good one.
