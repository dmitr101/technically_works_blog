Hey there. My name is Dmytro(or Dima for short), and I'm a game developer/software engineer. I'm interested in most aspects of game engineering, including gameplay, animation, audio, and rendering. I'm lucky enough to have had a chance to touch and play with all of them during my career. Besides game programming, I'm fascinated by programming languages, distributed systems, and many non-technical things such as music creation and travel.

Some notable projects I worked on include:

* Far Cry 6
* Star Wars: Republic Commando for PS4/PS5
* Arc Raiders
